DO NOT FORK THIS YET, REUPLOADING RHODUM'S FILES AREN'T FINISHED SINCE GITHUB DOESN'T ALLOW ALOT OF FILES UPLOADED

Stop creating issues asking for a zip file of the source, you're not getting it. Write code yourself if you want to run a revival.

If i continue to get GitHub emails from you guys asking for the source, i'm going to private this repo. Stop creating issues asking for the source.

# Rhodum
This repository is the official Rhodum source code and database. Warning that the code is very garbage. And it has 970 FUCKING FILES WHICH IS WHY I COULDN'T REUPLOAD ALL OF THEM!

# Why was this leaked?
Because Epiculy cannot run a revival. Rhodum contains a rat, and alot of 10 year olds actually trusted this. Reminder that this uses the Graphictoria source, so please do not use this dumpshit source on your shitty revival.

This is also the latest Rhodum source code. We have not leaked the database as it is <b>private</b>. But you can view the clean version of the database, <a href="https://github.com/qunjz/Rhodum/blob/main/RhodumDatabaseV2">here</a>, which means you cannot view user info such as useragents and other info. Credit to Table for the database, and Scott for cleaning it.

# Credits
Credit to Epiculy for scamming Edd, and getting the site beamed, and big thanks to Table for leaking the source, along with Scott for getting and ridding the database of IPs and other stuff, I have the database aswell (because Scott accidentally sent it in a gc lol). Big thanks to Edd for sending the source to Table and Table leaking it. Special thanks to salman khan (idk what he did but he was involved with the server nuke)!

# NOTE
DO NOT USE THIS INFORMATION IN ANY HARMFUL WAY. THIS INFO IS ONLY FOR INSIGHT PURPOSES. NO DISTRIBUTING HASHED PASSWORDS, USERAGENTS, ECT.  ~ Scott
